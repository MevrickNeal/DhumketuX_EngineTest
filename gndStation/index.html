🧭 1. System Purpose & Architecture

DETS enables testing of solid rocket engines in ground-locked configuration while maintaining control and data feedback from a safe distance.

✔ Live thrust curve streaming
✔ Ignition lock safety with servo
✔ Confirmed command execution
✔ Robust RF connection (LoRa link)
✔ Heavy-duty real-time UI for operators
✔ Data export and replay features

Subsystem	Role
Launch Pad Unit (LP)	Collects thrust data, enforces ignition safety, executes commands
Ground Station (GS)	Relays commands wirelessly and streams telemetry to UI
Web Dashboard	Displays thrust, system state, allows safe test execution
🔌 2. Hardware Pinout & Engineering Rationale
🛰 Launch Pad Unit — STM32 Bluepill
Component	Pin	Why this pin?	Function
HX711 Load Cell ADC	PB0	Timer-safe GPIO for stable capture	DOUT – thrust data
	PB1	Hardware clock line	SCK
LoRa RA-02	PA4	SPI CS line	Module selection
	PB12	Hardware reset	RF stability reset
	PB13	Interrupt-ready pin	RxDone/TxDone
	PA5	SPI SCK	Clock line
	PA6	SPI MISO	Receive SPI
	PA7	SPI MOSI	Send SPI
Ignition Relay	PC13	PC pins sink higher current, Active-LOW supported	0 → FIRE, 1 → SAFE
Safety Servo	PA3 (PWM)	Hardware TIM2 channel → smoother motion	0° SAFE, 15° ARMED
Status Buzzer/LED	PB10	GPIO w/ PWM ability for tones	Audible confirmation
DHT22 (future-ready)	PB15	Supports 1-Wire style protocols	Temp/Humidity

▶ Safety Note: LPU fails SAFE on any fault. Relay defaults HIGH (Safe).

🧭 Ground Station Unit — Arduino Uno/Nano
Component	Pin	Function	Why
LoRa RA-02	D10	Chip Select	Hardware SPI compatibility
	D9	Reset	RF module watchdog
	D2	DIO0 IRQ	Digital pin w/ external interrupt
	D11/D12/D13	MOSI/MISO/SCK	Arduino hardware SPI
LED Status	D8	GS Link indicator	Operator quick reference

⚠ Arduino is 5V. LoRa is 3.3V.
▶ Must use logic level shifting on every SPI + RST + DIO line.

📡 3. Communication Standard (ASCII-Based)

Firmware verified & locked.

GS → LP Commands
Command	Meaning	LPU Result	Safety Enforcement
CHECK	Request telemetry	LP responds OK,<kg>	None
ARM	Unlock servo & prepare ignition	Servo 0° → 15°	Relay still disabled
IDLE	Disarm ignition & lock servo	Servo 15° → 0°	Relay disabled
LAUNCH	FIRE	Relay LOW for ~300ms	Only if ARMED

State changes are confirmed visually + via buzzer.

LP → GS Telemetry Format

Main format:

OK,<kg>
NO,<kg>


Meaning:

Prefix	Interpretation
OK	Load cell calibrated & reliable
NO	Data valid but not calibrated

▶ UI multiplies kg × 9.81 = Newtons
▶ Fields logged to CSV with timestamp

Failure-proof: UI will graph regardless of OK/NO prefix.

🧠 4. UI Flow Explanation (Why each button exists)
Button	Action	Why it exists
CONNECT GS	Open USB Serial to GS	Without GS there is no link
CHECK	Request thrust sample	Required to verify communication
ARM SYSTEM	Enable ignition logic	Prevents accidental firing
DISARM / SAFE	Return to 0° servo	Required after every shot
LAUNCH	Send LAUNCH → countdown → fire	Final irreversible trigger
CANCEL/ABORT	Immediately IDLE root	Mission safety
Start Recording	Log thrust to CSV	Data analytics + reports
Replay CSV	Load previous test data	Verify improvements

The UI displays:
✔ Max thrust
✔ Ignition point auto-detection
✔ Time-to-peak

📊 5. Software Behavior Summary
Subsystem	Task
GS MCU	Filters & rebroadcasts serial → LoRa
WebApp	Converts kg→N, plots thrust curve
LP MCU	Processes safety logic & physical actuation
LoRa link fault protection

No OK/NO within 2 sec → Link Lost

LAUNCH command is enforced on LP only when ARMED

Firmware ensures software cannot override hardware-safety.

🧪 6. Test Procedure

Use this when Elon Musk calls you at 3 am:

Step	Action
1️⃣	Connect everything as per wiring table
2️⃣	Open WebApp in Chrome → Connect
3️⃣	Press CHECK → ensure thrust value streams
4️⃣	ARM → servo unlocks, ready state
5️⃣	Begin countdown via LAUNCH
6️⃣	Observe ignition + thrust graph
7️⃣	Relay auto-stops, LP reverts SAFE
8️⃣	Export CSV ✔ Done

Distance from engine: ≥ 15 meters recommended
Do not test in your bedroom. Yes, this line exists for a reason.

🧩 7. Developer Notes (Future Modifications)

If load cell wiring or scale sensitivity changes:
→ adjust calibration in scale.ino

If a new radio module is used:
→ update SPI pins & LoRa settings in LoRa.ino

If a different servo used:
→ adjust:

servo.write(0);   // SAFE
servo.write(15);  // ARMED


If someone edits safety logic to “make it simpler”:
→ Make sure your insurance plan is paid first.
